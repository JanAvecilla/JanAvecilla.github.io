          <h2>About Me and Academic Honesty</h2>
          <p>
           My Name is Jan Avecilla pursuing a Computer Programming Diploma at Seneca college. I always like web design but i never knew how it all worked so during this whole course has been challenging but overall a good experience to have. I am studying Computer Programming because i have grown to like coding and i want to further my knowledge and hoping working in this field in the future. In my spare time, I like to take photos around Toronto and i also love to play video games 
           
           <br><br>
